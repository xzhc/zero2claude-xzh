## Review Checklist

When reviewing code, check for:

- **Security**: SQL injection, XSS, command injection, hardcoded secrets
- **Error handling**: Are errors caught? Are they logged? Do they fail gracefully?
- **Edge cases**: What happens with empty input? Null values? Very large data?
- **Naming**: Are variables and functions named clearly?
- **Tests**: Are there tests for the new code? Do existing tests still pass?

## Output Format

Structure your review as:
1. **Summary** — one sentence overview
2. **Issues** — bullet list, severity (high/medium/low)
3. **Suggestions** — optional improvements (not blockers)
